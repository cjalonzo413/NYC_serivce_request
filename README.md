# NYC_serivce_request
-I've been asked to analyze data on service request (311) calls from New York City.

-I also utilized data wrangling techniques to understand the patterns in the data and visualize the major types of complaints.

-First EDA project I've done where I also reject or accept null hypothesis if the complaint type and location are related.
